# silverorange Coding Standards

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silverorange/coding-standard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silverorange/coding-standard)

Coding standards for silverorange PHP projects. These are standards to be used
with the [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki) tool.

## Per-Project Usage

per-project configuration is preferred over global configuration but does
require support to be added to the project. To use these rules for a project:

### 1. install as a require-dev dependency using composer

```sh
$ composer require --dev silverorange/coding-standard squizlabs/php_codesniffer
```

### 2. add a `post-install-cmd` and `post-update-cmd` to register the coding standard with phpcs

Post install and post update are both required because `composer install`
without a lock file will not execute the `post-install-cmd` script.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": "./vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths vendor/silverorange/coding-standard/src",
    "post-update-cmd": "./vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths vendor/silverorange/coding-standard/src"
  }
}
```

### 3. create a phpcs.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ruleset name="MyProjectName">
  <description>A custom coding standard.</description>

  <arg name="colors"/>
  <arg name="tab-width" value="4"/>
  <arg name="extensions" value="php"/>
  <arg name="encoding" value="utf-8"/>
  <arg name="warning-severity" value="0"/>

  <rule src="SilverorangeLegacy"/>
</ruleset>
```

### 4. create a composer script to lint the project

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "./vendor/bin/phpcs"
  }
}
```

### 5. add a Jenkins pipeline stage to automatically lint files

The code lint pipeline stage should be added before other pipeline stages so
they do not run if the code lint fails. See the
[Jenkins Pipeline Manual](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) for help
with adding a stage to an existing pipeline, or for help creating a new
pipeline.

For new packages:

```groovy
stage('Lint Modified Files') {
  when {
    not {
      branch 'master'
    }
  }
  steps {
    sh '''
      master_sha=$(git rev-parse origin/master)
      newest_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
      files=$(git diff --diff-filter=ACRM --name-only $master_sha...$newest_sha)

      if [ -n "$files" ]; then
        ./vendor/bin/phpcs \
          --standard=Silverorange \
          --tab-width=4 \
          --encoding=utf-8 \
          --warning-severity=0 \
          --extensions=php \
          $files
      fi
    '''
  }
}
```

For legacy packages:

```groovy
stage('Lint Modified Files') {
  when {
    not {
      branch 'master'
    }
  }
  steps {
    sh '''
      master_sha=$(git rev-parse origin/master)
      newest_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
      files=$(git diff --diff-filter=ACRM --name-only $master_sha...$newest_sha)

      if [ -n "$files" ]; then
        ./vendor/bin/phpcs \
          --standard=SilverorangeTransitional \
          --tab-width=4 \
          --encoding=utf-8 \
          --warning-severity=0 \
          --extensions=php \
          $files
      fi
    '''
  }
}
```

## Global Usage

The `SilverorangeLegacy` standard can be set to be used by default if no
per-project configuration is available.

### 1. Install standard globally

```sh
$ composer global require silverorange/coding-standard:dev-master
```

### 2. Register the standard with PHP Code Sniffer

You can use commas to delineate multiple paths.

```sh
$ phpcs --config-set installed_paths ~/.composer/vendor/silverorange/coding-standard/src
```

### 3. Set the global phpcs standard

```sh
$ phpcs --config-set default_standard SilverorangeLegacy
```

Now calling `phpcs` with no additional arguments will use the
`SilverorangeLegacy` standard.

## Standards

Several standards are provided:

### SilverorangeLegacy

Intended for linting the entire project for a legacy package. This omits some
rules we'd like to use for new code written for legacy packages in order to
run without error. It is not recommended to use this standard for new projects.

[Documentation](doc/legacy/README.md) exists for the legacy standard.

### SilverorangeTransitional

Intended for use as a post-commit hook or CI test. This ensures all new code
added to legacy packages follows best practices within the legacy guidelines.
This includes rules that will not pass for the entire project, but should pass
for all modified files in a new pull request.

### SilverorangeTransitionalPrettier

Based on [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) standard but updated to
support [Prettier code auto-formatting](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php).
The PSR-4 autoloading rules of PSR-2 are relaxed to allow our legacy code to
comply with the ruleset. This standard should be used for all legacy
silverorange PHP packages.

### Silverorange

Based on [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). PSR-2 builds on, and
includes all rules from [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), The
`Silverorange` standard extends PSR-2 to add forbidden functions.

For autoloading classes, projects must follow
[PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/). This allows efficient auto-loading
and promotes organizing code using namespaces.

### SilverorangePrettier

Based on `Silverorange` standard but updated to support
[Prettier code auto-formatting](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php). In
addition to PSR-2 rules, additional checks are included to promote code
quality and consistency. This standard should be used for all new silverorange
PHP packages.

### SilverorangePEAR

Based on `PEAR` standard but updated to not require method and class
documentation. This should _not_ be used for new packages.

## Sublime Setup

If you are using Sublime Text:

1. Set up Sublime Linter with PHPCS as described
   [here](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-phpcs).
2. In the Sublime Linter settings, make sure you have the following settings
   (do not remove the other settings):
   ```json
   {
     "user": {
       "linters": {
         "phpcs": {
           "@disable": false,
           "args": []
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Create a Sublime project in the project root.
4. Add the following to the Sublime project settings:
   ```json
   {
     "SublimeLinter": {
       "linters": {
         "phpcs": {
           "phpcs_executable_path": "{project}/vendor/bin/phpcs"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

This will allow you to use different rulesets with different projects.

## Atom Setup

If you are using Atom:

1. Set up linter-phpcs as described [here](https://atom.io/packages/linter-phpcs).
2. Open the package settings for linter-phpcs and set
   `Coding Standard Or Config File` to `SilverorangeLegacy` or whichever
   current coding standard you are using. Also set the `Tab Width` field to `4`.
